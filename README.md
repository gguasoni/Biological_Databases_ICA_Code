## Task
The focus of this assignment was to turn a list of ten gene identifiers into a queryable MySQL annotation database for biological discovery. The code uses my database on the university server, pulls relevant information about the ten genes from at least three external databases (ideally via different query methods), stores the results locally, and presents an integrated view in table form by querying the custom database. Running the script creates the database, performs the external queries, downloads and integrates the data, and then issues a final SQL query to output a summary table of the integrated resultsâ€”applying the approaches covered in the course and aiming for a design where one or two SQL queries can summarise the data.
